Hi Stav! in this version structure of SSM and SAM /SSMItems and SAMItems will be the same?
now in database I see difference SAMItem has relation with survey but SSMItem has only itemType field
Stav 16:33 please ignore existing SSM tableshi Mikhailcopy the SAM tables to new copiesthey will be the same
16:34So I create full copy of SAM?
Stav 16:34but different Step of courseyesexact copy
16:34different step - what do you mean?
Stav 16:34SAM is in Step 2 I thinkSSM is in step 3 I thinklet me check
16:35of course
Stav 16:35yes, that's what I meant
16:35ok
Stav 16:36step 1 -> SSMstep 2 -> SAMthe above is correct ^
11:18Hi Stav! When you will have time, explain what changes need to be done in SSM.

Hello @Mikhail. How is it going?
13:05Hi! I talk now with Stav about changes in SSM
Anthi 13:07please let's talk together about the changes in SSM to avoid any misunderstanding. Are you finishing with the frame files?
13:07yes, I installed the same functionality as SAM
Anthi 13:08great! Thank you!
Stav 13:08 ok sot here are a few differences
Anthi 13:09
First we start by Placing the text of the Vision text box as Item 1 at the center and we colour it blue
(and we write at the below corner that blue = Vision then the user clicks the + sign of Item 1at the modal window that opens
at the field "question" we write "identify the key elements of your current reality that can be increased or decreased"at
the field "action" we write "key element of current reality"we colour all items of this layer red (and we write at
the bottom red = current reality same thing as many times as the + sign of Item 1 is clicked
Then, when the user clicks the + sign of any of the red items, at the "question" field of the modal window
that opens we write "identify intervention projects" and at the field "action" we replace it with "Intervention projects".
Colour this green and write at the bottom green = intervention projectsInstead of lines we should use arrows all directed towards Item 1.
That is all about SSM. After that we start the SSM report
13:29 Anthi, try to explain Stav what do you want, because I not understand at all.
We have SAM page - and we need to do some changes - what changes we need to do?
Stav 13:30 ok let's take it one by one so 1)
Initial item will be called Vision and it must be filled in
13:31so it will be created in any situation when page loaded?
Stav 13:31 so I think, when we create the SSM we just ask the user to fill in first item (= circle) and we have to label this Vision
Anthi 13:31 NO
Stav 13:31only on new creation
Anthi 13:32 the user does NOT fill in the text of the Vision . He has filled it in at Step 0. we should copy it from Vision Text box
Stav 13:32 ok, yes, that;s even better
13:32 I mean page SSM - when user create new SSM we will create first item automatically?
Anthi 13:32 yes
Stav 13:32 yes, thats the point - we will create it autmatically default test is = with the vision of step 0
13:33I understand, and if he try to create SSM we will ask him first fill text?
Stav 13:33 no need just copy the text from Vision (from step 0)and create first item (circle) automatically
13:34 I mean if he not filled Vision text field we ask him to fill Vision field first
Stav 13:34well, it's always going to be filled now
Anthi 13:34 he can't go to SSM if not first finish
Step 013:35 ok, yes he even not open SSM, Anthi right
Stav 13:36ok so now 2)
Anthi 13:36before 2
Stav 13:36sorry , for 1) the default colour will be blue
Anthi 13:37yes
Stav 13:37for that first item
Anthi 13:37and we should write it also at the bottom corner that blue = vision
Stav 13:37ok@Mikhail the colours are essentially GroupIds so we need to add a Group called Vision and make
it blue let's make it a little different that the other blue because there already is a blue one I think
13:38 wait 1 min, I will show on screen
Stav 13:38 ok @Anthi if we leave it as is then the Vision item will be editable (and thus the user will be able to change it)
are we ok with that?

          """image1"""
word vision will be at this place?

the colour will be Blue because you will select group "Vision"
13:41"Vision" will be in red square?

          """"image2""""

we want them to use the text of the Vision text box of Step 0. Let them edit it if they want
Stav 13:42That's the group the red square will have part of the vision text
13:42ok, I understand about groups
Stav 13:42and it will show in the circle (the whole vision text)
13:43thats all clear
Stav 13:43okso step 2when you add a new item
13:43 text well be not editable
Stav 13:43 instead of "Question" label
Anthi 13:43ok
Stav 13:43needs to change to:
  "identify the key elements of your current reality that can be increased or decreased"
13:44 ok You mean placeholder?
Stav 13:44 label "action" we will call "key element of current reality" yes placeholder
13:44ok
Stav 13:45I will add the arrows to the graph@Mikhail please make sure that we have a new php file ssm1.php
13:46 I do not know how to add arrows
Stav 13:46 you need to load this in the iframe
13:46 I did new php file for ssm
Stav 13:46 not the one that you are loading now ok cool yes I will do the arrow inside this new file which one is it?
13:47I do not know how to add arrows in this library
Stav 13:47@Anthi for all items connection lines will be directed to the parent item
13:47ok
Stav 13:47not Item 1
Anthi 13:48yes
Stav 13:48all second level items will direct to item 1 all third level items will direct to their parent item
Anthi 13:48yes, sorry, this is what I meant
Stav 13:48 cool ok I think we are on the same page@Mikhail please give me the filename you are loading in the SSM iframe
13:49I will send file now, sow as all code is local you can`t load from internet, or I can give you link to github, 2 min
no probs send me anything you have
13:51header('X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL'); - ONLY for local version so as I use different local domain names
Stav 13:51ok
13:52mskorok/olbackhttps://github.com
Stav 13:52thanks
13:53send me file after changingSo thats all we need to do?
Anthi 14:06there is a little bit more, let's wait for
Stavro14:06ok
Anthi 14:18oh! AND 2 drop down menus with only 2 options at the beginning and at the end of each arrow2 options: Less or More
14:20not understand what do you mean - what dropdown?
Anthi 14:20let's wait for @Stav to finish and come back
14:20ok
Stav 14:21 sorry, on a call will come back here as soon as possible 15-20 mins
14:21ok
Anthi 14:21 ok do you want to talk about changes in the SAM while we wait?
14:26yes, let go
Anthi 14:26 ok 21. at the modal window that opens when the user clicks the + sign, the field "question" must be automatically filled in.
To fill it in we write "Why didn't + parent item text"
14:29ok
Anthi 14:302. the first item of the SAM should be the layer 3 (green) items of the SSM
(but they should be able to also chose "other" and fill in a different text)
14:30parent item question text or answer text?
Anthi 14:32answer text filled in at the field "action" of the modal window which is also the text that is put into the parent circle ok
the first item of the SAM should be the layer 3 (green) items of the SSM (but they should be able to also chose "other" and fill
in a different text) what do you mean?SAM and SSM 2 different not related models what do you mean layer 3?
Anthi 14:34after the current reality circles (coloured red), Stavros will tell you about what happens when the user clicks
the + sign of a red item, we get another layer of items which we colour green) and are the intervention projects in the SSM
14:35no comment - not understand at all
Anthi 14:35okwe need to take text that is filled in at the SSM and automatically make it the first item of a SAM
14:36SSM and SAM not related. You can`t do this
Anthi 14:37why not? For SSM we take text of Step 0 (vision)
14:37yes - but this text related to process, not SAM - SSM related to process
Anthi 14:38what do you mean "not SAM-SSM related to process"? SSM and SAM are steps of the process, no?
14:39SSM related to process model, not to SAM - there no relation with SAM
Anthi 14:40we just need to copy the text that the user fills in nothing else
14:41we can use only related data, if you haven`t any relation you can`t get data
Anthi 14:42hhmmm, let's wait for @Stav
14:42ok
Anthi 14:48the whole process is processing data from Step 0 to Step 3, we can't not relate data from SSM to the SAMso we should establish a relation
14:55SSM and SAM is models that related to Process, so we have one to many relation in one Process - many SAM and one Process - many SSM.
relation SAM -> SSM only via Process model, so you have Many to Many relations
Anthi 14:56in one process only 1 SSM many SAM yes
14:57Where it was declared? I see code with relations - there no limitations. We can limit it only on subscription level
Anthi 14:57ok we can limit it only at subscription level you see code with no limitations because you see the copy of the SAM code
 that is not limited, SSM had not be written if we limit it at subscription level, will it work?
15:00In previous version of SSM no limitation too
Anthi 15:01the previous version is Stav's new experts SSM module
15:01one moment - you said that may be subscription without SSM limitation
Anthi 15:01no, not for version 1SAM no limitation
15:02 I mean limitation for SSM
Anthi 15:02no, there should be always 1 SSM per process for Version 1 in the free subscription and in the paid subscriptions
15:03 so we can just use data from first SSM
Anthi 15:03 limitation of max 10 SAM at the free subscription (not of SSM)
15:04 I propose to wait @Stav, not to create misunderstanding, ok?
Anthi 15:04ok
Stav 15:04Will be with you shortly
15:04Hi Stav, there one new problem!!!!!!about texts - Vision, CR and Shared is this text the one for process or
it will different for each user ?
Now this text is located in Process model, but I understand now that we need to do it different for different users
Anthi 15:07no wait the VS and the CRS are different text per user BUT the Shared Vision text box and the Current reality
text box is one per process filled in by the process administrator
15:09ok, so what text we will fill in the first item of SSM - text created by admin?
Anthi 15:09 yes ok, solved Stav, we wait you
Stav 15:11 ok I'm ready what's the problem
15:11 we solved
Stav 15:11ok
Anthi 15:12please go ahead with the SSM you were at point 2
Stav 15:12 ok so point 2 I think we mentioned now
Anthi 15:12 only colours (red)red (sorry for this image I have no idea how it got there
15:13???
Anthi 15:14items of layer 2 should be coloured red
15:14what do you mean layer?we have items
Anthi 15:15items with parent item, item 1
15:16so for SSM child item of first item always will be with red color?
Anthi 15:16yes
15:16can user change it?
Anthi 15:16no
15:17it will be new color or we use color from existent groups?
Anthi 15:19Stav?this I don't know what to answer, I am waiting for @Stav's opinion
15:20ok
15:28the first item of the SAM should be the layer 3 (green)
Anthi 15:28 then children of children always green
15:28 may be you meat third item ? next question - now in SAM first item may have many children - how it will be in SSM?
Anthi 15:30 same
15:30so there may be many third level items
Anthi 15:30 yes these items we call "intervention projects"
15:31so how you identify third item wich will be used to create first item in SAM?
Anthi 15:32 user choses at the beginning of each SAM from a drop down menu perhaps?
15:33 thats all not 'little changes' - its again rewrite from scratch
Anthi 15:33:( thats why I was not optimistic about how long time it take
Anthi 15:35what is your estimation about time?
15:36may be week
Stav 15:36...
15:36 do not know, without estimation
Anthi 15:36ok@Stav there is one question above about colour red and then can you continue with the SSM please?
15:39red color will be new or from some current variant?
Anthi 15:47new
15:48ok
Anthi 15:51@Stav?
15:54@Anthi you can explain me now about SSM report
Anthi 15:54okdo you want me to finish with SSM first?
15:54ok
Anthi 15:54ok so you got 2 right? (about red items)children of item 1
15:55yes
Anthi 15:57ok so now 3. children of children of item 1 should be all green. At the "question" label you replace
it with "identify intervention projects" and label "action" you replace with "intervention projects"of
the modal window
15:58one moment - in SAM user can choose group. And color depend from group.
Is there will be group dropdown or no?
Anthi 15:58no need colours in SSM will be standard central item = blue, children items = red, children of children items = green
16:00next - placeholders (labels) - please write again for all items
Anthi 16:01 ok for children items placeholder named in SAM "question" should write now "identify key elements of the current reality
that can increase or decrease" and label "action" should write now "key element".
For green items the question label should write now "identify intervention projects" and the "action label should write
"intervention projects"
16:06no, please 1 item(color blue) : question - "", answer: - ""; 2 item (red) : question - "" , answer - "";
3 item (green) : question - "", answer - ""; to prevent misunderstanding
Anthi 16:07ok1 item no labels as it is written automatically, right?
16:08there 2 fields - answer and question - answer we will take from Vision text But what about question?
Anthi 16:09Identify your vision
16:09ok
Anthi 16:102 items (coloured red) question: "identify the key elements of current reality that can be increased or decreased"
   answer: "key element"3 items (coloured green) question: "identify intervention projects" answer "intervention projects"
16:11ok thats clear
     the answers are going into the circles as text
16:11ok
Anthi 16:12 4. change lines into arrows (Stav) said will do it5. place two drop down menus at the beginning and at the end of each arrow.
The drop downs have only 2 choices: Less/ More
16:13????what do you mean arrows there?
Anthi 16:14@Stav here we really need your wisdom about how to do this
16:14you mean to add dropdown to image with balls?
Anthi 16:145 is the last change yes except if @Stav has any better idea of how to do this
16:16I can`t to do it in any case it may some years to rewrite this js library :)
Anthi 16:16 then we need to think another way to signify Less or More
16:17what will do less or More?
Anthi 16:17will be used at the report
16:17how?
Anthi 16:18 each arrow, one sentence: "Less/More of Item 2 results in Less/More of Item 1"so that the user can figure out what projects to do
16:20we can`t do anything at image with balls, forget it.
 If Stav add arrows instead lines it will be great result . No more.
Think in categories - items, not arrows.
Anthi 16:21ok the same if we think about items we want to find out and write at the report that
 "More/Less of Item 2 results in More/Less of
item 1"
16:22so we can just open dropdown. How it will be opened?Now I not understand sence of More and Less
Anthi 16:23 example:my vision = to make OL science accessible to all my current reality item red 2: not enough scientific
literature my intervention project item green 3: research so now I should find out if I should do MORE or LESS of research in order to
achieve my vision so more research results in more accessible OL science for all
16:26;(
Anthi 16:26ha ha haI am sorry we need @Stav here
16:27we have dropdown with 2 fields - more and less for each type of items?
Anthi 16:28for each item
16:28for each item we have one dropdown?
Anthi 16:28yes, I think so@Stav we need you!!!!
16:29and if we choose one of 2 value - what we will do with this value?we have question, answer and value of dropdown
 - what we will do with this?
Anthi 16:31the value of the dropdown will be used in the report. 1 sentence per item (since we don't think in arrows)no
real need to signify it on the image we just want it to make the sentences for the report
16:32ok, I will open report now 1 min
Anthi 16:33ok
16:34 More [OR “Less” depending on ......] of ....variable/stock..... results in more of .........variable/stock....try
to explaine
Anthi 16:34variable/stock is item
16:34we have 3 text string
Anthi 16:34 forget "depending on"
16:351. question, 1. answer, 3. value how it will be combined?
Anthi 16:37the question and answer are part of the modal window in order to create the map.
 The value should be filled AFTER creating
the map and we will use it only in the report by forming one sentence per item "More/Less of (answer of item 2)
results in More/Less of answer of item 1 text"question is used only to for the user to find and fill in the answer
16:39 ok, I understand so depth of items will be 3, but we can give ability to create unlimited amount of items of 2 and 3 lavel?
Anthi 16:41yes
16:42after creating items user will estimate (more/less) ?
Anthi 16:42yes
so this dropdown will appear after item created?
Anthi 16:43it needs to be filled in after all 3 levels of items have been created
16:44okso main unsolved question - where locate dropdown - I think Stav has some ideas.
Anthi 16:44ok, great about the report (to finish with this as well) only complexity to form the sentences with More/less
that I told you about . All the rest is standard text
16:47i understand.one more question - if we have 3 type subscription - answers will be shown to all users or user can see
only own answers?
Anthi 16:50answers will be show to all users
16:50ok, so we wait @Stav
Stav 16:51how can I help?
16:52about more/less dropdown - do you have any ideas where it will be located?
Stav 16:53I think it must be in the dialog that appears and you simply edit it if you want to change it
16:55wait - more/less will appiar when 3 green item will be created
Stav 16:55hmmm yes
16:56maybe we will add checkbox to item with more and less fields?
Stav 16:56yes
Anthi 16:56that's a great idea!
16:56and store results id separate model - ssm Report for each user@Anthi - question - ssm report will be single (for one user) ?
Anthi 16:58no in 3 type of subscription
17:00 so if every user will estimate - how can we create group report? we can calculate olset index,
   but more/les is not calculatable!
   Anthi 17:02no need for OLSET Index this is calculated at the Evaluation report.
   What do you mean more/less is not calculable. We ASSUME that the 12 users will provide the same value for the same items.
   If there is a difference let's ask the administrator to decide less or more this report does not have numbers and statistics,
    just sentences
17:03not understand!!!!!!each user can set more and less
Anthi 17:03:(
17:04you have 12 users so for 1 item you need or calculate some median data or give data for all users
Anthi 17:05we assume that all 12 users put the same value at the same item so we use the common value
17:05but more/less will be different
Anthi 17:06IF it is different, then we use the value assigned by the administrator
17:06okwill user in 3 type subscription have single report?
Anthi 17:07no
17:07ok thats all
Anthi 17:07ok
Anthi 17:40@Mikhail, I forgot to mention that when you take the text from the green items to put it as the first item in SAM you should add
 the words "why didn't " at the beginning of the text please
 17:44okAnthi
 17:44thank you




Dear @Mikhail I hope that you are very well.
Dear @Mikhail and @Stav I know that this is not the right time for work but you can read it and reply when you can.
I hope that at least one of you has an idea regarding how to signify the different values of Item 1 of the SSM
as this is an item that will have as many values as the items in layer 2 of SSM items.
all other items have only one value (either more or less) but Item 1 has many values actually the critical
thing is not really to signify it but to differentiate between the items and their corresponding value
for the SSM Report18:44@Anthi do you want to rewrite project once more?
Anthi 19:27Hi @Mikhail. I hope you are very well. rewrite project? What do you mean?
19:28Yes, you need to change structure, its led rewriting of all SSM block
Anthi 19:29for the different values of item 1?you remember we said that each item has a question,
an answer and a value?19:30Item now has only 1 value
Anthi 19:30yes, ok , very good, this is correct
we just need to figure out a way to write inside the report (when Item 1 is used) which item of layer 2 it is related
with and that item will tell us what value (Less or More) to put before the item 1 while writing the report
19:34Not understand what do you mean
Anthi 19:34ok in SSM, each item has 1 value, this is correct but this is because you instructed me to think
regarding items rather than regarding arrows. this means that ok for every item corresponds 1 value
BUT not in the case of Item 1 because Item 1 has many children not just one and for each child
Item 1 might have different value. We don't need to see this in any way but we need to separate the different
values when we write about Item 1 inside the report maybe @Stav knows a simple way to do this
19:41Try to explain it to Stav. Main problem is to understand what do you want
Anthi 19:42ok, yes, I will explain it to @Stav when he gets in Skype. I am sure he has been thinking about this already
are you all right with your health?
19:45No i need some time to reabilitation, but I try to finish this project
Anthi 19:45oh, is there any way that I could help?




ok, thank you for being so courageous and focused professional who wants to finish the project at hand regardless
of other circomstances!how many days do you think are needed to finish the project?19:49I do not know.
I think that we can estimate at the end of next week
Anthi 19:51ok, thank youHave a nice night!
19:54Have a good night!Anthi 15:21@Stav, we need your help
Stav 12:15@Mikhail Hi, I'm in a call, when I finish it, I'll come back here.
Anthi 12:23Good morning @Mikhail. I asked @Stav to call me so that I can explain him in Greek as we said
13:31Ok
Stav 14:05ok I understand now what the problem is@Mikhail do you use the systemic_structure_map_chain table?
Anthi 14:21Hi @Mikhail. I told you I am sure that @Stav has already thought about it!
15:00Of course, this table create relation betwean items
Anthi 15:14@Stav?
Stav 16:52hello yes exactly in there you can add two field sand the GUI can save these values in thereI think it is
 self explanatory once you see the table
 16:53What will be in fields?
 Stav 16:54lets make these fields integer1=more
2=lessor enum[more,less]
16:56Ok
Stav 16:56two feilds from_value, to_value or from_weight, to_weight
16:58Ok
Stav 17:06based on this, when do you think this can be ready?
Anthi 17:29Hi @Mikhail, when do you estimate that we will deploy project?
19:10I can't estimate, I do not know can I work even 1 hour a day.

Anthi 7:46Good morning @Mikhail. What tasks are still left to be done?
10:01Ssm and report Sam need to be rewrited accoarding with new ideas
Anthi 10:03SAM?
10:05Yes, last time you changed spesification for Sam creation, so this functionality must to be rewrited
Anthi 10:07we just want to connect layer 3 items of SSM to Item 1 of SAM. Is there anything else that we changed in SAM?
oh yes and text at the label of question in the modal window.
2 changes, how much time do you estimate for these 2 changes? Maybe @Stav could help?
10:12Yes, so we need to remove part of frontend and bpart of backend and create new functionality.
How Stav can help if in any case this part must be rewrited. If you change specification you must understand
- new specification need new code.
Stav 10:12ok one seclet me understand exactly what's neededand I'll tell you specific steps
10:14We need to add mechanism of creation of first item in backend and frontend




yes let me think about it for a few mins
Anthi 10:17in other words (so you can think) we want each item of Layer 3 of SSM to become one Item 1 of SAM
(but the paying subscribers can also edit Item 1 of SAM thus do more projects that those of layer 3 items of SSM)
Stav 10:17wait
Stav 10:45Ok I have all the information about the project
Stav 10:551) When adding 2nd level items in SSM

- the question must be: "What elements of your current reality can be increased or decreased."

2) When adding 3rd level items in SSM:

- the question must be: "Identify intervention projects."
- a new SAM must be created with a level 1 item with question text based on the 3rd SSM item.

3) In SSM we must:
- add more/less fields to the chain table and provide CRUD functions to add/edit these values. Also add these fields in the creation & edit dialog.
- In the items listed under the tree, add the two more/less values leftmost and rightmost in the list item
   (i.e. the two bottom corners)4) The SSM report
10:56Stav, we discuss about sam, not ssm In current code first item created by user
Stav 10:57As far as I know, the chages n SAM are very small. The first time must still be abe to be created by user
10:57So this code must to be changed
Stav 10:58the difference in in item 2) above:

2) When adding 3rd level items in SSM:

- the question must be: "Identify intervention projects."
- a new SAM must be created with a level 1 item with question text based on the 3rd SSM item.10:58We need to rewrite controllerStav 10:58when a new 3rd level SSM item is created, then a new SAM is created with a default item10:58So as now all items created by the same codeStav 10:58there already is code to create a SAMthere will be two ways to create a SAM:
1) As it is now, by user
2) When a 3rd level item is created in SSM
11:01 Yes, we need to add new code for first item and remove all frontend part for first item creation,
 then we need to rewrite controller at frontend no more.
 So its mean to rewrite current functionality
Stav 11:12why remove all parts for creation? the user will still be able to create SAMs in the way they can now
Ok, I did not know about this, so not remove old - add additional functionality
Stav 11:36yes
Anthi 11:37and we forgot to mention: add text in question label of SAM modal window "Why didn't we +parent item text"
11:39I want to clarify one moment - about first item of sam - its the one item or may be several ?
Anthi 11:41 maximum 10 for the free version and unlimited for the paid subscription. Is this what you mean "several"?
11:42I mean sam item of first level not sam
Anthi 11:43only one
in first level
11:44Ok, so user can't create new item of first level - only choose from dropdown?
Anthi 11:45I would answer YES but if the user uses the old way of editing he/she can create another SAM.
 But always only one item at level one
11:47What do you mean old way of editing?
Anthi 11:48sorry, I should had written old way of creating item 1with the old way of creating item 1
 (which is needed only in the two paid subscriptions) the user can create a SAM's first item that is not in the drop down
 but always only one item at level one
 11:51So he can choose to create from dropdown or create new?
 Anthi 11:52yes (only the paid subscription users). The free version users can use only the first 10 items of the drop down
 11:56Ok, Anthi all this details I need to know BEFORE starting coding, not AFTER code created.
  In other case we will finish in 2020 New Year :)
Anthi 12:01YES you are absolutely right!!!! :( BUT as you said "the programmer is the translator of the thought into
code and if the thought is not clear, then the code doesn't work".
The truth is that all these details come up in my thought as we move to the creation of each task.
@Stav with the previous team did a miracle as my thought was very unclear.
So now as we work together at each task, all these details come up.
I am sorry for this. But I assure you that there is no other detail that will come up since
I think that just now with this last detail we have all specifications for the conclusion of the project.
12:05I think that we will have some such moments, it will be in any case. The biggest problem is my illness,
 it make work much slow.
 Anthi 12:06how many days do you need for recovery?
 12:07I do not know. I have problem will vessels of brain. All diagnostic will be finidhed in Friday.
 Anthi 12:08oh I am so sorry. I hope everything will go great with your health. It is ok if you work slower.
  What can we do? These things happen to human beings




Thats why I said that can estimate time at the end of week
Anthi 12:09ok we are humans thus we have to accept our limitations and vulnerabilities.
 We just have to keep on trying for the best possible
 12:14I hope I can solve this problem
 Anthi 12:15my best wishes are with you
 12:15Thank you!
 Anthi 12:18Thank you for having the courage to work despite this!
 Stav 12:23hope you get well soon @Mikhail!!!
 12:24Thank you!
 Anthi 12:30but regarding what is left to be done for this project, everything is clear?
 Stav 12:30the only thing I forgot to mention is the Question that is item 1 in the SAM
 which should be the compy of the SSM 3rd level item plus something
 Anthi 12:31no no every question of SAM (including item 1) should be "why didn't we + parent item text"
 Stav 12:33the first item is created automatically so that should be:
Why didn;t we + level 3 item from SSM
Anthi 12:33not plus something at the end, plus something at the beginning , yes, sorry
Stav 12:33the rest f the item in SAM, at the moment are free text...yes, sorry that;s what I meant
Anthi 12:34ok sorry I didn't understand correctly




Hi @Stav! we have structural problem. @Anthi says that subscription will allow 1 SSM and 10 SAM.
In our structure SAM and SSM related to process (many to one).
So if you allow one SSM it will be related only to one process.
If you want to use data from SSM in SAM you can use SSM and SAM related to the same process.
But if we allow 1 SSM amd 10 SAM - some SAM will be related to another process as SSM.
 So we can`t use information from SSM. pls clarify this moment.
 Stav 10:07 hi that's correct I think we should NOT have a limitation to the SAM
10:09limitation to SSM you mean?
Stav 10:09because if you do, then it is the same as not allowing full usage of ONE SSM
lets wait until @Anthi comessh must decide after we explain
Anthi 10:10Good morning @Mikhail and @Stav
10:10I`m think so, if we add limitation to SSM system will not work
Anthi 10:10exactly! at the free version it is like not allowing full use of SSM since most probably there will
be more than 10 items at the 3rd level so we give 10 projects (SAMs) for free but if they want to use more SAMs
they will have to buy a subscriptionI didn't really understand the structural problem.
Can you explain me please?10:13@Stav pls explain @Anthi in Greek, so as this is technical problem
and she not understand what I mean
Anthi 10:14yes please @Stav call me in Skype (BTW FYI again I am not receiving any notifications....)
Stav 10:15Ι ςιλλ βε ψαλλινγ υοθ ιν αππροχ 1¨30 ηοθρσI will be calling you in approx 1:30 hours
10:18And one more question - how much SAM will be for one process - one or many?
Anthi 10:18 many at the free version maximum 10at the paid versions unlimited
10:21if we have limitation in SAM and one process can have many SAM so we need to create mechanosm to calculate
 how much process we can create. So as if we not have this inspection we may create process without ability to create SAM
 Anthi 10:23"how much process we can create" ? What do you mean?
 10:27I mean if you limited SAM you need limited creation of process.
 And this amount must be calculated depend of how much SAM will be created for one process.
  So we need to change code in process creation - add inspections on amount of SAM and processes
  Anthi 10:28does it take a lot of time to create this inspection mechanism?




@Anthi, I will not estimate time at all, because each new step lead to rewriting project.
I do not know what new problems will appear. If we will work so as we do now - every time rewrite current functionality
- I believe that we will finish to 2020 New Year
Anthi 10:38ok, no we don't want that what happens without these inspections?
10:42just it will not work - we need to do åll chånges in åny case. Ånd I såid you thåt I wås not optimistic åbout SÅM.
Anthi 10:42:(
10:43just be patient
Anthi 10:43ok
And HAPPY NAME DAY! It is a big celebration of the Archangels Mikhail and Gabriil today here
(and also Angel's which is the name of my son)
10:45Спасибо!
Anthi 10:46:)I know that much Russian as my mother was born in Taskendi, Russiais your health better?
10:49Thanks, I will have result of diagnostic tomorrow, so I`m not work before results,
but I try to clarify all questions not to do unnecessary work
Anthi 10:50ok, great, thank you Inspections will be only for SAM number?
10:54yes, but this moment we need to clarify before starting.
So as one process can have some SAM - we must deny creation of project if we created all allowed SAM
By the way - Tashkent is not Russia, its Uzbekistan and one of beatifull ancients cities.
Anthi 10:57:) (It was when she was born and living there, it changed to Uzbekistan after she had moved back
to Greece)ok@Stav will explain me more as I can't say that I have understand completely
11:00ok, I wait your decision - so now thats all questions, but not the last
Anthi 11:01ok :)
Anthi 11:45but, now that I am thinking about it, and as far I understand before @Stav explains me,
there is no decision to take since if we don't do this inspection the process will not work, right?this is what you said, right?
11:49@Stav proposed to limit SSM so as SAM - if we have 10 SAM we will have 10 SSM - its good decision.
 But I think that we must add next limitation - one process - 1 SSM and 1 SAM
 its will solve some problems - we will not need any inspections
 Anthi 11:50but we had said that yes we do limit SSM to one per process, no?why if we have 10 SAMs we will have also 10 SSMs?
 11:53in any case there must be more then one SSM in subscription, at least 1 for process
 Anthi 11:53in any case, for the paid subscriptions we must give unlimited SAMs yes SSM 1 per process always




ok, so we solved this question - 1 SSM per process not per subscription
Anthi 11:54yes 1 SSM per process always no, per process
Anthi 14:01Hi @Mikhail, after this clarification, is there any other question to solve or no?
14:02now any questions
Anthi 14:03Should @Stav still explain me what you were saying before about inspectors of amount of SAMs per process?
14:03no
Anthi 14:04a ok, thank you




Good morning @Mikhail and @Stav. I was going through the testing process in my mind as the group version testing
will be done with my workshop team. I would be the administrator.
It came up that there must be a way for the administrator to notify the managers/users about which part
of the process they need to work on. Perhaps for the initial we can skip creating a functionality
as the administrator will send an email to the managers that the process started and they must go in the software to fill it in.
Then SSM ok, they continue the process.
But for SAM me (the administrator) want to indicate to the managers WHICH SAM I want them to work on. How do we do this?
Anthi 8:02do I send them a link perhaps?
Anthi 8:09I don't want to add more coding/time please, let's find something easy
9:26@Anthi, I think you want to hire programmer full time and pay for all your ideas in this case you can rewrite code
last infinity
Anthi 9:27no, I don't want to add more time PLEASE
I want something that will just work for the first version, for the second version we will have a chat and everything.
I think this notification that I am talking about is something that @Stav has predicted for already
and yes I told you that I would like to hire you part time at the beginning and then full time to create the second version.
But this is for later on. Now we must finish version 1 as soon as possible
9:35Now I work for free and lost mach time and lost much money - you must understand that I pay for flat rent,
 for food, for medicine and more, more , more .
And I pay real money, every your idea -its my lost money by the way.
I promised to Stav to finish this project, but I see that its impossible becфuse every time will be new ideas.
Anthi 9:40I am losing a lot of money too due to the continuous delay due to new ideas.
Believe me I am more in hurry than you to finish this project!
I am at a state that I have borrowed money to pay for my medicine for 1 more week.
After that I don't know what I will do as the only income I wait for is from this software.
But this idea can be something as simple as adding the text to the instructions
"The administrator at this point should send a kind email to its managers explaining which SAM he wants the managers
to fill in at this point in time." , no need to add coding and thus timeI have saved for your payment,
don't worry about that of courseI have to leave for a while but I will be back.
Please we don't want to add more time and coding with this new idea,
we can just add the above sentence in the already existing instructions text!
Anthi 12:17Hello @Mikhail and @Stav. I am back
Stav 12:46hello
Anthi 12:48hello @Stav please read today's posts by me and @Mikhail above
Anthi 12:55I remember @Stav's idea about this was to have a list at the dashboard
BUT we can save this for version 2 as this needs time. For now, can we just copy-paste the above sentence
in the existing instructions @Mikhail ?
Anthi 13:04@Mikhail, @Stav, are you there?
Stav 13:04hi yes sorry guys I m having to answer constant queries and phone calls got about 20 people
who need me at any time
Anthi 13:05you really need to use OLSET @Stav! :)
Stav 13:05hahahaI think we can do that. the copy/paste of the instructions
Anthi 13:07ok, if we can do this it will be great@Mikhail, do you think we can do this?
13:12I think wed did final instruction 2 weeks ago
Anthi 13:15you had asked me about "how many times will the instructions change?" and I told you about twice.
It was when you also asked me about "how many times will help section" change and I told you that I will be changing
it through the WP functionality. Are we talking about the same "instructions"?by instructions I mean the "i"
("info") field on the menu next to the "back" button that you created
we don't want to add any task, PLEASE we want to finish as fast as possible
Anthi 13:32@Mikhail, do you remember us having this conversation?
Do you remember the task of moving text from Help to the "info" button?
Anthi 13:38I hope YES. now, in the text of the SAM's "i" ("info) button please just copy/paste one more sentence.
This doesn't take time, right?no? it needs time??Is there a way that I can have direct access to change the "info"
myself?@Mikhail, are you there?
Anthi 14:36:(Stav 14:37I will be offline for about 2 hours or longer, if you need anything please post and I will answer later
Anthi 14:42I would like to talk with @Mikhail to clarify
16:16Hi @Anthi, sorry I had to leave for several hours in the hospital. I did all work with info button as was in Trelo
and our conversation, we can add any text, not a problem. I think we will do it after deploy.
I mean no more any principal changes.
Anthi 16:18yes, NO MORE CHANGES PLEASE
and yes it is much wiser to do it after testing because during testing I think I will improve a lot these texts
16:19yes
Anthi 16:19ok, great, thank you!




Hi, sorry
I mean when you finish SSM let us know by writing that you finished it so that
I can take courage that we are close to finishing
14:36We will be close to finish after deploy
Anthi 14:36correct indeed still, we are 3 steps away from deployment, so please when you finish each step just write it here.
It will really make me feel that we are progressing 3 steps I mean:
SSM, SSM Report, SAM
Anthi 8:07Good morning @Mikhail. I am sorry to bother you all the time but I am really extremely anxious about
finishing this project. Please can you tell me where you are today and how many days you estimate
that are still needed to reach deploy please?
9:12I'm in hospital today
Anthi 9:16OK, I hope your day there will go smoothly! But until yesterday, in terms of the six tasks list that @Stav wrote,
 have you finished any of these six tasks?
9:18What list?
Anthi 9:21Do you remember 2 weeks ago that @Stav wrote you a list of 5 tasks that remain to be done and then we also
 added one more task (we had talked about it already when @Stav came back to complete
the list of tasks)it is here above in our conversation practically @Stav broke down the 3 steps into six tasks
 9:25Sam, report, ssm and part of subscriptions,
(I rewrited subscription functionality because new ideas about sam and ssm)
Anthi 9:25 yes so you categorised it into 4 tasks, that's great, OK. And you finished task number 4 (part of subscriptions),
this is what you say, did I understand correctly?
9:27Yes
Anthi 9:29ok, great. So now 3 tasks remain (SAM, SSM Report and SSM).
Can you estimate how many days are needed to finish these 3 tasks?
@Stav says that with 4 hours of work per day, it will take about 7 days
9:32You not understand at all, I have VERY big problems with health, I refused 2 projects where clients pay money for work.
I try fo finish this in dangerous condition. What estimate do you want?
Anthi 9:36@Mikhail I am really sorry that you are going through this. I understand you because I also have
VERY big health problems. And as I wrote you yesterday, I don't have any more money to pay for my next week's medicine!
So just tell me honestly how much you can really work per day?
9:38This week I worked only 2 hours.In previous time i worked more than 400 hours
Anthi 9:50Yes @Mikhail, I know that before you entered the hospital you have worked very much and very well!
I deeply appreciate this and this is why as I told you I want to continue working with you for the next projects too.
And we agreed that after you deliver the project you will get 1K and maximum 30 days later another 1K.
This is a sum of 2K for your work. But in order for me to take money and give also to you your money,
 the project must be finished. If I knew programming I would do it myself.
But I don't know so I need you and @Stav to finish the project so that we can ALL GET PAID PLEASE!!!
According to @Stav another 28 hours of programming are needed
9:53Just wait. i am not shure about 28. I will finish in any case.
Anthi 9:56ok
Anthi 11:19@Mikhail, I am sorry to bother you again but I reread our conversation and just a wail ago you said that it is
dangerous for you to work. Consequently (no matter how much I appreciate your determination to finish the project)
 I am wondering if you can work next week? If it is dangerous you can't , right?
 Stav 13:11My estimate was 40 to 56 hours, not 28. Sorry for the mistake.
 Anthi 13:15ok, sorry for the mistake too
 Anthi 14:26To be specific @Stav estimated 7 working days
 Anthi 15:01but, @Stav you were also counting the time to change part of subscription which @Mikhail already did
 so according to this estimation, now the project can reach deployment stage at about 5 working days
 Anthi 15:20the whole point now is if @Mikhail's health allows him to work these remaining 5 days
